An application that registers new users and logins existing users is created in the host machine, using primarily:
- php: backend
- mysql: RDBMS
- html & css: frontend

1. From the web server VM, sshfs was used to mount this host directory containing app/: `sshfs sid@192.168.42.214:/home/sid/app <mount-point> -o reconnect`
*mount-point* should have write permissions for the user. After mounting the host directory, copy the app/ folder to web server VM. 
2. By default nginx, serves static files placed under /var/www/html, so move the app/ contents there.
3. Since we need to serve php files we will use php-fpm to process our php code. For that install php-fpm: `apt-get install php-fpm`
4. First, edit the /etc/nginx/sites-available/default file accordingly and also create a symlink in /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/ if you happened to create a custom config file under /etc/nginx/sites-available/
<br>Here is default file with some changes<br>
```
server {
        listen 80;
        root /var/www/html;
        index index.php index.html index.htm;
        server_name example.com;
 
        location / {
            try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
        }
 
        location ~ \.php$ {
            include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
            fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php7.3-fpm.sock;
        }
}
```
5. Restart nginx and php-fpm daemons: `systemctl restart nginx.service` and `systemctl restart php7.X-fpm.service`.
6. Make sure to check there statuses after restarting, there might be some sweet errors which should not difficult to troubleshoot.
7. Also make sure that the mysql daemon is running and you are able to connect to your database.
Following these steps would be enough for our puny application.
