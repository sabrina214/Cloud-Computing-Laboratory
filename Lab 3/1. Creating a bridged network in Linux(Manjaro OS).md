There are several ways to go about creating a bridge. Using iproute2, bridge-utils(although it is deprecated and its use is discouraged), network-manager, etc. I have used iproute2 here because it is readily shipped with almost all linux distros.<br>
<br>**Creating Bridge with iproute2**
<br>`sudo ip link add <bridge-name> type bridge`
- verify that bridge is created and state is *down* by: `ip a show <bridge-name>`

**Adding interfaces to bridge**
<br>`sudo ip link set <interface-name> master <bridge-name>`

*Note: This works as it is for ethernet interfaces but for adding wireless interfaces refer <a href=https://wiki.debian.org/BridgeNetworkConnections#Bridging_with_a_wireless_NIC>this</a>*
- The state of added interface might be *down*, so change it to *up*
- Check that interfaces are added to the bridge use the bridge utility; also part of iproute2 package: `bridge link`
- Enabling stp is required if there is more than one router involvment.

The bridge link state might also be *down* so make it *up*: `sudo ip link set <bridge-name> up`

**Assigning IP to bridge**
- For dynamically assigning IP, use the dhcp client: `sudo dhclient <bridge-name>`, or
- For static IP, `sudo ip addr add <bridge-name> <desired-ip>`
