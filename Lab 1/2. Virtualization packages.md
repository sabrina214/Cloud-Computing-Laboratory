**Mandatory packages**<br>
- libvirt - The libvirtd daemon conrtols the hypervisors, manages VMs and library calls.
- qemu - Replaces qemu-kvm
- qemu-img
In Arch-based systems, which is what I am using install these using `sudo pacman -S qemu libvirt`. qemu-img is installed as a dependency

**Additional package used in this lab to create VMs**
- virt-manager - GUI-based VM manager also known as Virtual Machine Manager(VMM); uses libvirt-client library.
Installation: `sudo pacman -S virt-manager`

**Enabling and starting and verifying libvirtd**
<br>`sudo systemctl enable libvirtd`
<br>`sudo systemctl start libvirtd`
<br>`sudo systemctl status libvirtd`
