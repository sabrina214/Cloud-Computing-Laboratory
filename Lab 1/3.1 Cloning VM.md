I will be creating a network of two VMs both having Debian 10 OS, so I decided to clone the previously created VM so that I do not have to repeat those steps. Later on I would be configuring network interfaces using network manager, so before cloning the VM i recommend that install network-manager so you do not have to install again explicitly on the cloned VM. For Debian installation: `apt-get update && apt-get install network-manager`.<br>
<br>Once Network-Manager is installed do not make any cute changes except installing Network-Manager and any other packages like openssh-server(for eg, I will be using sftp for transfering some files across these VMs, although this is unecessary). Before cloning any configurations specific to the VM must be deleted. Since we have not touched any other configuration except installing Network-Manager, our VM is ready to be cloned. Thus it is also a better idea in our case to not have configured the network before VM creation because that would have meant that each VMs would have different IPs for their interfaces, which would have to be removed before cloning.<br>
<br>Since I will be using Network-Manager to configure ethernet interfaces on all VMs so I do not want interfaces.d to decide for my ethernet interface. So comment the following line: `iface enp1s0 inet dhcp` in `/etc/network/interfaces`(filepath may differ for different distros)

<br>Once this is done shutdown the VM. Right-click on the VM and choose clone.
