1. Right-click on the QEMU/KVM and click on details or goto Edit :arrow_right: Connection Details :arrow_right: Virtual Networks.
2. Stop the *default* network (Should also work without stopping this network because we will be putting our VMs in our own created separate network. In that case, this *default* NAT network will be active but our VMs will not be in this network ).
3. Click + (Add Network)
  - Enabling IPv4 is upto you but I will be manually configuring IPs for my two VMs. Click Finish
