1. Open Virtual Machine Manager(VMM)
2. Choose: `File` ‚û°Ô∏è `Add Connection`<br>
<br>![Add connection wizard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75603064/121123835-81244780-c841-11eb-9c65-e538545ab37c.png)
  - Make sure hypervisor is QEMU/KVM. Let connect to remote host with ssh be left unchecked, and check or uncheck autoconnect as per your liking. Keeping it checked will make the connection online everytime the VMM is opened. Click connect.
3. There are couple of ways of creating a VM from here.
  - Right click on the created connection and click New; or
  - Choose: `File` ‚û°Ô∏è `New Virtual Machine`; or
  - clicking on the VM creation icon in the menu.
4. Once VM creation wizard pops up, then;
<br>![Choose installation media](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75603064/121124817-2ab80880-c843-11eb-93c3-9c8fe6e92df4.png)
<br>For me it's Local install media(ISO file)
<br>![Choose ISO file](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75603064/121125015-77034880-c843-11eb-9672-11716829ddc9.png)
<br>Browse the ISO file, VMM will try to autodetect the OS variant. For me it's Debian 10. Click Forward.
<br>![Error msg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75603064/121125601-728b5f80-c844-11eb-8319-cc2bb37732d4.png)
<br>The error occured due because I had the installation media on a different partition, a simple resolution here may be copying the ISO file to the current partition.

<br>Although this particular debian image can be installed with 512MB successfully but I found 812MB to be working sweetly. I chose to not install GUI for this demonstration because it was unnecessary and not having a GUI made things work fasterüôÇ.

<br>Allocate space for persistent storage(this will create a qcow2 file in /var/lib/libvirt/images/). You can also choose from a storage pool if you have one or can create one. You can create a hard disk file using qemu-img, eg; `qemu-img create -f qcow2 debian10 8G`

<br>Name your VM and preview the configuration you have determined so far. Also Network should be NAT by default and should be activated. If we had created a virtual isolated network before VM creation then we could have selected that network from dropdown here. But that can be done later with np. Click Finish
<br>Now the installation should start.
<p>Similarly, create another VM following similar steps.
