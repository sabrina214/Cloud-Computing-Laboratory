1. Verify that your ethernet interface of your VMs does not have an ip `ip a`.

2. Since I have not a graphical interface for my guest Debian OS. So I will be text-user interface of Network-Manager - `nmtui`. Use Tab to move forward and Shift+Tab to backward, Spacebar to Toggle, ESC to Back.
  - Start `nmtui` - A not so appealing blue screen appears

  - Choose `Edit a Connection`

    - In case you do not see *Wired Connection X* then either you have not commented the `iface enp1s0 inet dhcp` in `/etc/network/interfaces` file. So after commenting that again start nmtui and choose `Activate a Connection` and deactivate it. Go back and again choose `Edit a connection`, now it should be there for you to configure it. You might have to wait a few seconds or restart networking.service by `systemctl restart networking`.
   - Click Add and create Ethernet.

   - Change IPv4 configuration to Manual. Assign some private IP, 10.0.0.101/24 in my case and gateway 10.0.0.1. Save and go back.

   - Choose `Activate a Connection` and activate it.
3. Verify whether ip is assigned to your ethernet device or not. If it does not then restart networking.service. This might take a few seconds to reflect and check again.
<br>*Note: Once I had encountered the problem where even being on the same network and having restarted networking service multiple times I could make one of VM reachable to other VMs in the same network. Finally I shutdown the VMs and stopped the isolated network and restarted the VMM, and it worked without any other changes. I do not understand this behavior but restarting everything seemed to work somehow.* ðŸ˜•
<br>*And there was also one instance of human error where I misconfigured the CIDR value thus my subnet mask was incorrectly configured, as a result it became inconsistent with my gateway address, thus I could not reach out to other VMs.* ðŸ˜›

4. Repeat these with other VM as well with some different IP in the same class and same gateway.

5. Verify whether they are visible to each other or not: `ping 10.0.0.101` from 10.0.0.102 and vice-versa.
